# opencobra/jeweler: Output

## Introduction

This document describes the output produced by the pipeline. The directories listed below will be created in the results directory after the pipeline has finished. All paths are relative to the top-level results directory.

## Pipeline overview

The pipeline is built using [Nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io/) and processes data using the following steps:

- [FETCH_SBML](#fetch_sbml) - Optionally, attempt to download an [SBML](https://sbml.org/) document from a given model identifier ([COBRApy](https://opencobra.github.io/cobrapy/)).
- [VALIDATE_SBML](#validate_sbml) - Validate the SBML document for use with constraint-based analysis ([COBRApy](https://opencobra.github.io/cobrapy/)).
- [MEMOTE_REPORT_SNAPSHOT](#memote_report_snapshot) - Test the model in the SBML document with the genome-scale metabolic model test suite ([MEMOTE](https://memote.io)).
- [MultiQC](#multiqc) - Aggregate software version and citation information.
- [Pipeline information](#pipeline-information) - Report metrics generated during the workflow execution.

### FETCH_SBML

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Output files</summary>

- `sbml/`
  - `*.sbml.gz`: Compressed SBML document that contains the requested metabolic model.

</details>

Use [COBRApy](https://cobrapy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/autoapi/cobra/io/web/index.html) to download SBML documents from either the [BioModels](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/biomodels/) or [BiGG](http://bigg.ucsd.edu/) repositories.

### VALIDATE_SBML

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Output files</summary>

- `validation/`
  - `*.json.gz`: Compressed JSON report of all warning and error messages related to the SBML and model validation.

</details>

Use [COBRApy](https://cobrapy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/autoapi/cobra/io/sbml/index.html#cobra.io.sbml.validate_sbml_model) to validate SBML documents with SBML and COBRA-specific rules.

### MEMOTE_REPORT_SNAPSHOT

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Output files</summary>

- `memote/report_snapshot/`
  - `*.html`: A self-contained, comprehensive HTML document describing the metabolic model test results. Can be viewed in your browser.

</details>

Use [MEMOTE's snapshot report](https://memote.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started.html#snapshot) feature to functionally test the metabolic model and generate a comprehensive report.

### MultiQC

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Output files</summary>

- `multiqc/`
  - `multiqc_report.html`: a standalone HTML file that can be viewed in your web browser.
  - `multiqc_data/`: directory containing parsed statistics from the different tools used in the pipeline.
  - `multiqc_plots/`: directory containing static images from the report in various formats.

</details>

[MultiQC](http://multiqc.info) is a visualization tool that generates a single HTML report summarising all samples in your project. The pipeline has special steps which allow the software versions to be reported in the MultiQC output for future traceability. For more information about how to use MultiQC reports, see <http://multiqc.info>.

### Pipeline information

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Output files</summary>

- `pipeline_info/`
  - Reports generated by Nextflow: `execution_report.html`, `execution_timeline.html`, `execution_trace.txt` and `pipeline_dag.dot`/`pipeline_dag.svg`.
  - Reports generated by the pipeline: `pipeline_report.html`, `pipeline_report.txt` and `software_versions.yml`. The `pipeline_report*` files will only be present if the `--email` / `--email_on_fail` parameter's are used when running the pipeline.
  - Reformatted samplesheet files used as input to the pipeline: `samplesheet.valid.csv`.

</details>

[Nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/tracing.html) provides excellent functionality for generating various reports relevant to the running and execution of the pipeline. This will allow you to troubleshoot errors with the running of the pipeline, and also provide you with other information such as launch commands, run times and resource usage.
